# Remote Work

I've worked remotely for three years and also been required to go into an office. What's right for you as an individual and the company depends on how you, the team, and the company operate. 

Whether you're a full-time remote employee or you have to go into the office each day, there are some principles that I believe really strengthen communication. 

* Know when you're productive. Reserve that time to do your best work.
* Collaborate. Don't withdraw and isolate yourself. 
* Share information easily.
* Communicate asynchronously.
* Prefer wikis over email but recognize email still has a place.
* Use the right tools to set your team up for success.
* Know your daily, weekly, quarterly, and yearly goals. Work towards them.
* Recognize that remote working isn't for everyone.
