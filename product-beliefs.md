## Product Beliefs

A quick bulleted list about what I believe products should be:

* Speed is a feature.
* Quality over quantity.
* Maintain a clean and transparent backlog.
* Intuitive UI/UX.
* Longer battery life is generally better.
* Thinner can be better.
* Make it delightful to use.

When developing products: 

* Always learn from your MVP.
* Scope is not an excuse for poor quality.
* Establish champions.
* Trust your reference customers but be willing to build something different.
* Don't compromise on quality.
* Iterate quickly. 
* Prototype cheaply.
* Solve problems.
* Have fun.
