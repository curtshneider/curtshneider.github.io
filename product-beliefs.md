## Product Beliefs

A quick bulleted list about what I believe products should embrace:

* Speed as a feature.
* Quality over quantity.
* Intuitive UI/UX.
* Longer battery life is generally better.
* Thinner can be better (but not always).
* Delightful to use.

When developing products: 

* Focus on your end users.
* Always learn from your MVP.
* Scope is not an excuse for poor quality.
* Establish champions.
* Trust your reference customers but be willing to build something different.
* Don't compromise on quality.
* Iterate quickly. 
* Prototype cheaply.
* Solve problems.
* Have fun.

When managing backlogs:
* Maintain a clean and transparent backlog.
* Play the ticket game - connect your smallest item to your objectives.
* Empower your team to understand the why.
