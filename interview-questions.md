## Interview Questions

A collection of original and linked interview questions that I like.

If you're interviewing for a product role and looking for questions to ask the individual interviewing you, read [John Cutler's post](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/21-questions-for-your-pm-role-interviewer-70827b21a85 "John Cutler's 21 Questions for your PM Role Interviewer")
