## On Hiring

Hiring the wrong candidate is a drain on productivity, team morale, and costs unneccesary money. To help identify the right candidate, I try and answer the below questions using this scale.

* 0 - Unable to form an impresssion
* 1 - No experience or desire to learn
* 2 - Below Average
* 3 - Average 
* 4 - Above Average
* 5 - Excellent

#### Customer First
Customers are the heart and soul of every business. Whether you're hiring for a sales position or an internal technical support position, every single position should understand who they are trying to delight. 

* Is there a sense of our customers (primary and secondary)?
* Is there a past track record of delighting customers?
* Does the candiditate speak positively or passionately about customers?

#### Team Fit
* Are they a happy person?
* Will they play well with others?
* Are they humble?
* Will they teach others? (Mastery)
* Can they commnicate with different team members?
* Will their personality gel with the team?
* Does their work ethic match the teams?
* Do they have a fun personality?
* How do they prioritize work? (Autonomy)

#### Personal Growth
* How does this position fit in their career trajectory?
* Will they have room to grow?
* Why here and why this team? (Purpose)
* How much do they learn? 

#### Intangibles
* Will they raise all ships?
* Are they a "so-so" hire?
* Do they like the work?
* Do they like the people?

#### Notes
This is a section for me to write my thoughts down. It helps to keep track of items not listed above. 

Below is a real-life example of my notes from a previous interview, sanitized and blinded, of course.

> Previous agile experience. No experience with SAFe. Balanced new feature development and production support. Asked good questions about priority. Focused on team interactions and build.
>
> Got on some werid topics. Initially, I agreed with almost all of what was said but when pressed for more specifics, I really started to question approaches and ability to work with the team.
>
> Sensed multiple previous dev-qa disagreements and explained how I would prefer product owners and scrummasters to be involved.
>
> Had to re-ask questions to have the appropriate answer given.
>
> Pros:
> * API Testing experience
> * Automation experience
> * Seemed very competent
>
> Cons:
> * Almost not mention of customers unless I brought it up
> * Seemed a bit aloof
> * No usability testing
> * Little accessibility testing
